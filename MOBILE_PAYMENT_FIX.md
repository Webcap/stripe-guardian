# Mobile Payment Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Mobile payments went through but showed "incomplete subscription" status because the webhook wasn't handling the `checkout.session.completed` event.

## Root Cause
When a mobile user completes payment:
1. Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` event
2. Your webhook **wasn't handling** this event
3. Later events like `customer.subscription.created` would fire
4. But the subscription status might still show as `incomplete` initially

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `checkout.session.completed` Handler
**File**: `api/stripe/webhook.js`

This new handler:
- ✅ Immediately updates premium status when payment completes
- ✅ Retrieves full subscription details from Stripe
- ✅ Sets `is_premium = true`, `subscription_id`, and `subscription_status`
- ✅ Works for both subscription and one-time payments

### 2. Improved Subscription Handlers
Updated `handleSubscriptionCreated` and `handleSubscriptionUpdated` to:
- ✅ Only set `is_premium = true` when status is `active` or `trialing`
- ✅ Better logging for debugging
- ✅ Always update `is_premium` based on current subscription status

## What Happens Now

### Payment Flow (Mobile)
1. User completes Stripe checkout on mobile
2. Stripe redirects to `/payment-success-mobile`
3. **`checkout.session.completed` webhook fires** → User marked premium immediately
4. `customer.subscription.created` fires → Confirms premium status
5. `invoice.payment_succeeded` fires → Additional confirmation
6. User session refreshes → Premium features active ✅

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the webhook changes** to Vercel (stripe-guardian project)
   ```bash
   cd stripe-guardian
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Verify webhook endpoint** in Stripe Dashboard:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Ensure `checkout.session.completed` event is selected
   - URL should be: `https://your-stripe-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Make a test payment on mobile
   - Check Stripe webhook logs
   - Verify user becomes premium immediately

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy webhook changes to production
- [ ] Verify `checkout.session.completed` is enabled in Stripe webhook settings
- [ ] Test mobile payment with test card
- [ ] Check webhook logs in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Verify user shows premium status immediately after payment
- [ ] Verify subscription shows as "active" not "incomplete"

## Stripe Webhook Events Now Handled

1. ✅ `checkout.session.completed` - **NEW** - Handles payment completion
2. ✅ `customer.created` - Syncs new customers
3. ✅ `customer.updated` - Updates customer info
4. ✅ `customer.subscription.created` - Creates subscription record
5. ✅ `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates subscription status
6. ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted` - Handles cancellation
7. ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Confirms successful payment
8. ✅ `invoice.payment_failed` - Handles failed payments

## Troubleshooting

### If subscription still shows incomplete:
1. Check Stripe webhook logs for errors
2. Verify webhook secret is correct
3. Check Supabase user_profiles table for the user
4. Verify `stripe_customer_id` matches between Stripe and Supabase

### Check webhook status:
```bash
# In Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

### Manually test webhook:
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## Notes
- The webhook is in the `stripe-guardian` project
- The mobile app is in the `wiznote-new` project
- Make sure both are using the same Supabase database
- Webhook endpoint should be publicly accessible
